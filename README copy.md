# Vid-To-GIF ðŸ“¹
Simple web based video (specifically mp4) to GIF converter. Built using React and ffmpeg webassembly library.

This applicatoion is highly inspired by a webassembly tutorial by fireship.io https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OTc0Ki7Sv0&t=393s&ab_channel=Fireship and this application is not really cross-browser compatible, it is only available on browsers that built on top of Google Chrome (such as Brave).

This app is merely a personal-experimental project trying out what webassembly could do on the front end.
